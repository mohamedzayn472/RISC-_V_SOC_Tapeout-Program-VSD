# 🖥️ RISC-V Reference SoC Tapeout Program VSD

<div align="center">


Welcome to my journey through the **SoC Tapeout Program VSD**!  
This repository documents my **week-by-week progress** with tasks inside each week.

> *“In this program, we learn to design a System-on-Chip (SoC) from basic RTL to GDSII using open-source tools. Part of India’s largest collaborative RISC-V tapeout initiative, empowering 3500+ participants to build silicon and advance the nation’s semiconductor ecosystem.”*

## 📅 Week 0 — Setup & Tools

| Task | Description | Status |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| [**Task 0**](Week0/Task0/README.md) | 🛠️ Tools Installation — Installed **Iverilog**, **Yosys**, and **gtkWave** | ✅ Done |

### 🌟 Key Learnings from Week 0

- Successfully installed and verified **open-source EDA tools**.  
- Gained familiarity with **basic environment setup** for RTL design and synthesis.  
- Prepared system for upcoming **RTL → GDSII flow experiments**.
